 <h2 style="font-weight:bold;">A Data Scientist and Investment Advisory Intern</h1>

    <p align="justify">I'm Vinicius Mesel and I am currently working on data science, data analysis and reporting services for investment analysis. Previously, as an undergraduate researcher and bioinformatician, I was working on bioinformatic approaches on schistosomiasis and cancer epigenetics at the <a href="http://www.butantan.gov.br" target="_blank">Instituto Butantan</a> on <a href="http://www2.iq.usp.br/docente/verjo/" target="_blank">Professor Sergio Verjovski's lab</a>.</p>
    <p align="justify">
      I used to work on bioinformatics and machine learning approaches for LNCaP cells. My work done on the lab is available at this <a href="http://vmesel.com/lncap-paper.pdf" target="_blank">weblink</a>.

      I'm interested in generating value for companies and people by creating simple solutions that can solve "pains" in their process. My personal interests range from open source software programming to gaming.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm very passionate about Python and to help people find jobs envolving Python development, I've built <a href="http://www.pyjobs.com.br">PyJobs</a> which is a job finding platform.
