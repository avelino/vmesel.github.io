{"name":"VMesel","tagline":"Vinicius Mesel - Python and PHP Programmer","body":"### Why I have chosen Python?\r\nSo my question is not so simple to answer as it appears to be. I started programming in 2007 when I was 8 years old in my fathers company(I work there 'til now), in that time I had a little experience with HTML and CSS(very little, my pages appeared to be from the 80s), and I was evoluting until 2012, the year that I have discovered Python, the language that changed my life completely.\r\n\r\nMy first code in Python was:\r\n\r\n`print(\"Hello World\") #Python 3.0`\r\n\r\nThat language freaked me out, because at that time I was watching some coding series on YouTube that are from Harvard, the CS50 and CS51, and they were teaching C(a compiled language that is the base for Python.) and it was so different from what I saw in C, it was more simple. This came in my mind as a treasure and until today got addicted to Python and do some different stuff.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
